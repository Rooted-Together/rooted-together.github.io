# Rooted Together

## :zap: Quick start
We are using [Astro](https://astro.build), a web framework, and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com), a css framework.

Here are the helper dependencies:
```
── @astrojs/image - Makes images load faster
```

Please refer to [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) to learn how to contribute to this project.

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
├── public/
│   └── favicon.svg
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── Card.astro
│   ├── layouts/
│   │   └── Layout.astro
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
├── package.json
├── astro.config.mjs
├── .gitignore
├── astro.config.mjs
├── README.md
├── tailwind.config.js
└── tsconfig.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
